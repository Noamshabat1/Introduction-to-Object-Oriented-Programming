/**
 * The 'bricker.main' package is the operational core of the brick-breaking game, orchestrating its
 * overall management and execution. Central to this package is the BrickerGameManager class, which
 * acts as the pivotal coordinator and driving force behind the game. This class is tasked with
 * several key responsibilities:
 * - Initializing the Game Environment: It sets up the game world, including the creation and arrangement
 * of various game objects, thus laying the groundwork for the gameplay.
 * - Managing Game Objects: BrickerGameManager oversees the lifecycle of all game elements, ensuring
 * their proper functionality, interactions, and timely updates.
 * - Controlling Game Flow: It regulates the progression of the game, handling transitions between
 * different stages, levels, or states, and maintaining the overall game rhythm.
 * - Facilitating Interactions: The class acts as a mediator for interactions between different game
 * components, including player inputs, collision responses, and strategy implementations.
 * - Handling Game Logic: It encapsulates the core logic of the game, making decisions based on game
 * rules, player actions, and various game events.
 * The BrickerGameManager class is, therefore, integral to the game's functionality, ensuring a
 * seamless, engaging, and well-coordinated gameplay experience. Its design and implementation are
 * crucial for the cohesion and smooth operation of the entire game.
