/**
 * The {@code image_char_matching} package is designed for advanced image processing and ASCII art
 * generation, leveraging character brightness matching for artistic and computational purposes.
 * It includes classes that encapsulate methods and algorithms for converting images into ASCII
 * representations by matching image brightness with character brightness. The package integrates
 * innovative principles from physics, specifically the concept of momentum, to enhance runtime
 * efficiency and minimize unnecessary computations.
 * Classes included in the package:
 * {image_char_matching.SubImgCharMatcher} - Matches characters to specific brightness levels in an
 * image, inspired by the principle of momentum. It is designed to optimize character matching processes,
 * enhancing performance and reducing unnecessary calculations.
 * {image_char_matching.CharConverter} - Converts characters into a binary image representation (2D
 * array of booleans), simulating a black and white image of the character. Essential for calculating the
 * brightness of individual characters, supporting the brightness matching in {@code SubImgCharMatcher}.
 * This package is ideal for generating ASCII art from images, enabling users to transform visual content
 * into text-based representations. Its performance optimizations make it suitable for applications
 * requiring real-time ASCII art generation or where computational resources are limited.
 * Developed and tested for compatibility with Java 11.
