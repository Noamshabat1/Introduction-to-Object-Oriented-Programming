1.Match the UML diagram of the code you created, briefly explain the role of each class in your code
 and the relationships between the departments:

    1. **SubImgCharMatcher**: Matches characters to sub-images or to a image based on brightness levels,
    facilitating the core mechanism for converting images to ASCII art.

    2. **CharConverter**: Converts characters into a binary representation using a 2D boolean array
    (16X16), essential for analyzing how characters visually represent brightness levels in ASCII art.

    3. **SubImage**: creates a an array of sub-images from the original image, on a given resolution the
    class is used to break down the image into smaller parts, which are then used to match characters to.

    4. **PaddingImage**: This class return a new 2D array with the adjustment of every image to the next
    size to the closest power of two. This is used to ensure that the image is the correct size.

    5. **Image**: This class is the main class in the image package for handling and creating a image
    object. It is used to load the image and to get the image's width and height.

    6. **calcSubImageBrightness**: Calculates the brightness of sub-images, a critical step for matching
     characters based on their visual weight or brightness.

    7. **Shell**: The class acts as the primary interface for user interaction, handling commands
     to manipulate characters, change image resolution, load new images, and toggle between console and
     HTML output for ASCII art. It integrates functionalities from other classes, such as Git for version
     control and SubImgCharMatcher for character matching based on image brightness. This class
     orchestrates the ASCII art generation process, responding to user inputs and invoking the necessary
     components to render ASCII art based on the provided or modified parameters.

    8. **Git**: The class is humorously named to suggest it acts like a storage or caching mechanism, but
     it's actually used to save and retrieve characters' brightness values and ASCII art images based on
     their names. It uses two HashMaps: one for associating characters with their brightness values and
     another for storing ASCII art images. This facilitates performance optimization by avoiding
     recalculating brightness values for characters or regenerating ASCII art that has already been
     created. This class effectively serves as a database within the application, enhancing efficiency
     by caching frequently used data.

    9. **AsciiArtAlgorithm**: Central to the ASCII art conversion process, this class orchestrates the
    overall algorithm, utilizing other classes to convert images into ASCII art.

    10. **AsciiOutput**, **HtmlAsciiOutput**, **ConsoleAsciiOutput**: Handle the output of the ASCII art,
     with specific implementations for different mediums (e.g., HTML pages, console).

    11. **KeyboardInput**: Handles user input, such as selecting images for conversion or
    adjusting  parameters for the ASCII art generation process.

The relationships between these classes suggest a structured approach to converting images into ASCII
art: images are loaded and possibly adjusted for size (Image, PaddingImage), broken into sub-images
(SubImage),  analyzed for brightness (calcSubImageBrightness), and matched with  characters
(SubImgCharMatcher, CharConverter). The output is then  formatted for display (AsciiOutput,
HtmlAsciiOutput, ConsoleAsciiOutput), with user input potentially guiding the process (KeyboardInput).
The Shell and Git classes are less directly related to the ASCII art generation and might serve auxiliary
or support roles.

2.Briefly explain for each Java data structure you used in the code, where you used it, and why you chose
 this particular data structure for the task. Consider runtime and memory complexity considerations in
 the explanation:

- **HashMap**: Utilized in `SubImgCharMatcher` and `Git` for quick access and manipulation of data
    related to character brightness and ASCII art caching. It offers O(1) average time complexity for
    insertions, deletions, and lookups, making it ideal for these use cases.

- **PriorityQueue**: Found in `SubImgCharMatcher` for managing brightness values efficiently. It enables
    the retrieval of minimum and maximum brightness values with O(log n) insertion and O(1) retrieval
    time, essential for matching characters to brightness levels.

- **Set**: Used in `SubImgCharMatcher` to ensure the uniqueness of characters, benefiting from O(1)
    average time complexity for basic operations like add, remove, and contains.

- **2D Array of Colors (`Color[][]`)**: Used in `PaddingImage` and `SubImage` for pixel manipulation and
    sub-image extraction, providing a straightforward way to handle image data.

- **3D Array of Colors (`Color[][][]`)**: In `SubImage` for storing extracted sub-images, allowing for
    organized manipulation and processing of image parts.

- **2D boolean array**: In `CharConverter` for representing characters in a binary image form, offering a
    simple and efficient way to analyze character shapes for ASCII art.

- **1D Array (`double[]`)**: In `calcSubImageBrightness` to store brightness values of sub-images,
    allowing for easy iteration and processing during ASCII art generation.

Each chosen data structure aligns with the goal of optimizing runtime and memory usage, considering the
specific requirements of tasks like image processing, character to brightness mapping, and ASCII art
generation.

3.Explain how you used the Java exception engine to handle errors in user input and print error messages:
In the `Shell.java` class, the Java exception engine is leveraged to handle errors in user input and print
 error messages in various ways:

    1. **Catching Exceptions for User Commands**: The `run` method has a try-catch block that captures
    exceptions thrown during command processing. If an `IllegalArgumentException` or
    `IllegalStateException` is thrown, it prints the exception's message to the console. This approach
    is used to give feedback on specific errors like incorrect command formats or operations that cannot
    be performed due to the current state of the application.

    2. **IOException Handling**: It also catches `IOException` specifically for image loading errors.
    If an exception occurs when loading an image (in the `loadNewImage` method called from
    `handleExtendedCommands`), it prints a predefined error message indicating a problem with the
     image file.

    3. **Specific Command Error Messages**: Within the `handleExtendedCommands` method, several
    operations (like adding or removing characters, adjusting resolution, changing the output type) are
    wrapped in their logic that might throw `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid inputs. if your are
    trying to use renderAscii without any character loaded, it throws an exception of the type
    IllegalStateException because we cant execute asciiArt algorithm without characters. The error
    messages for these exceptions are predefined (e.g., `ADD_ERROR_MESSAGE`, `REMOVE_ERROR_MESSAGE`,
    `RES_ERROR_MESSAGE`, `OUTPUT_ERROR_MESSAGE`) and are designed to inform the user about the mistake
    in their input.

    4. **Error Handling in Main Method**: The `main` method contains a try-catch block for handling
    `IOException` that might be thrown when initializing the `Shell` object with an image file. It prints
     an error message along with the details of the exception if the specified image file cannot be opened.

This structure ensures that the application can gracefully handle user errors, provide specific feedback,
and continue running without crashing, making the interaction robust and user-friendly.

4.Did you make any changes to the SubImgCharMatcher class-API? explain why the changes were needed in the
code:

yes, we have added the clear method to the SubImgCharMatcher class, this method is used to clear the data.

5.If you made changes to the code of the departments provided to you? explain the changes and why they
were needed. (Note Do not make changes to the code of the classes in ascii_output package as this package
is not being submitted!)

no, we did not make any changes to the code of the classes in the image package
