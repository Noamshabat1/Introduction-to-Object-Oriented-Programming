/**
 * Provides comprehensive image processing functionalities, including calculating brightness of
 * sub-images, managing images, padding images to the next power of two, and extracting sub-images.
 * This package is designed to facilitate advanced operations on images for applications that require
 * detailed image analysis and manipulation.
 * Key functionalities include:
 * Calculating the average brightness of sub-images based on a defined formula, useful for image analysis
 * and processing tasks where brightness levels are critical.
 * Initializing and managing images, allowing for operations such as loading from files, saving, and
 * accessing pixel data, providing a foundation for further image processing tasks.
 * Padding images to the next power of two, a common requirement for many graphical processing algorithms
 * and operations, ensuring compatibility and optimization for various processing techniques.
 * Extracting sub-images, enabling detailed analysis and manipulation of specific regions within
 * larger images, supporting tasks such as texture analysis, pattern recognition, and more.
 * This package is essential for developers working on applications requiring detailed and
 * sophisticated image processing capabilities, offering a robust set of tools for a wide range of
 * image manipulation tasks.
