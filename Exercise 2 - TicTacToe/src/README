Strategy Explanation:
1. WhateverPlayer strategy: 'WhateverPlayer' does not follow any strategy and randomly selects positions on
   the board to place their mark.

2. CleverPlayer Strategy: 'CleverPlayer' starts filling the board from the top left corner
   (row '0', column '0') and proceeds systematically across the rows and then down the columns.

3. GeniusPlayer's Strategy:
  - First Move: 'GeniusPlayer' deliberately skips the first column during its first turn.
    This means if 'GeniusPlayer' goes first, it leaves the top left corner open, potentially luring
    'CleverPlayer' into a trap.
  - Subsequent Moves: After the first move, 'GeniusPlayer' switches to a standard filling strategy, covering
    all columns. starting in the columns hes already in (row '0', column '1').

    In defeating CleverPlayer
    The strategy of 'GeniusPlayer' is specifically crafted to counteract the strategy of 'CleverPlayer'.
    Let's break down how this works:

    1. CleverPlayer Strategy: 'CleverPlayer' starts filling the board from the top left corner
       (row '0', column '0') and proceeds systematically across the rows and then down the columns.

    2. GeniusPlayer's Counter-Strategy:
    - First Move: 'GeniusPlayer' deliberately skips the first column during its first turn. This means
      if 'GeniusPlayer' goes first, it leaves the top left corner (the starting point for 'CleverPlayer')
      open, potentially luring 'CleverPlayer' into a trap.

    - Subsequent Moves: After the first move, 'GeniusPlayer' switches to a standard filling strategy,
      covering all columns. This change in strategy can be unpredictable for 'CleverPlayer', which follows a
      predictable pattern.

    In conclusion, while 'GeniusPlayer' strategy does not guarantee a victory against 'WhateverPlayer' in
    every scenario,(but in a big probability) it offers a tactical approach against 'CleverPlayer' that
    exploit the predictable pattern of 'CleverPlayer', and guarantee a victory in every round!.

2) In this project I have implemented few approach's and uses of fundamental pillars of OOP, particularly:
   abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation and information hiding. Let's break down how each of these pillars
   is involved:

   1. Abstraction
   Abstraction in OOP allows you to focus on the 'what' over the 'how.' By using an interface for players,
   you define a set of behaviors (methods) that all player classes must implement, without specifying how they
   should be implemented. This abstraction in our project allowed me to implement different types of players
   (like 'HumanPlayer' or any 'BotPlayer') to be treated uniformly at a high level.

   2. Polymorphism
   Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. When player classes implement a common
   interface, they can be used interchangeably within the game, even though each class may have a different
   underlying implementation. For example, this abstraction in our project allowed me to implement different
   players where each object of 'HumanPlayer' or any 'BotPlayer' is being treated the same in the eyes of the
   game.

   3. Encapsulation
   Encapsulation is the ability to implementing an interface can help in encapsulating behavior. Each player
   class encapsulates its specific behavior while exposing a common set of functionalities to the outside
   world.

       3.5 Information Hiding
       Continuing the Encapsulation, this also hides the internal implementation details and ensures
       that other parts of the codebase interact with the agreed API and API objects only through their
       exposed ( public ) methods.

   4. Open/Closed Principle
   Because we have implemented our code in this form we are inlined with the principal and can use it in our
   project.
